# TheGallery
This is a simple one page project, made for the Google Android Basic Challenge 2017.

As Art Historian I want to experiment all programming possibilities to create sth interesting in my job.

This App (made for the Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program) is part of my purpose.

It's on a fictional business, the Art Gallery if the Dutch collector Jan Gildemeester Jansz in Amsterdam.

My choice is based on the free license pic of the painting of Adriaan de Lelie (Rijksmuseum), taken from Europeana.eu database: https://www.europeana.eu/portal/it/record/90402/SK_A_4100.html?q=painting+gallery

That's all folks.
